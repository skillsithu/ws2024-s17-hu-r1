# WorldSkills Lyon 2024 National Competition HU, Skill 17 (Web Technologies)


## Round 1

Below you will find the most important information about the first round of the competition.
### General Information
In this round, you will be asked to complete a website development task. You can use any preparation resources you like to complete the task at home, but you must complete the task independently and the work must reflect your skills and knowledge.

After the assessment of the submitted tak, the top 10 competitors will be interviewed in person. Afterwards, 6 competitors will be selected to compete in the one-day semi-final (expected date of the semi-final is Saturday 01.04.2023). 

#### How and when to submit your work:

You must submit your work in two formats:

1. Source code in GitHub repo

	To submit your assignment, you will need to share a GitHub repository (hereafter referred to as repo) containing the source code of your solution. YY is the two-digit personal code that we have emailed to you. If you have not used GitHub before, you can register an account at https://github.com and then create a private repo as ws2024-s17-r1-YYY, where YYY is the three-digit serial number we have emailed you. 

	If you haven't used git at all, it's high time you got to know it. It's not a devil's toy, and you won't need it to get very deep into it just yet. It's enough to have a basic understanding of how it works, and to use the basic functions to upload your finished work to the repo you've created. 

	You then need to share the repo containing your solution with us. To do this, use our GitHub id `skillsithu`.

2. Deploy the finished website using the Netlify service 

	a.	Netlify is a free service where static websites can be shared with the public. The service works by linking a web application you create on Netlify to a GIT repo (in our case, a GitHub repo you created for the round task) When you push a new commit to the central repo, Netlify will create a new build based on it and publish it immediately to the public address associated with the app. If you can only use native HTML/CSS/JavaScript triples, the build (the package prepared for publication) will be virtually identical to the source code. Don't be scared, it's much simpler than it first looks! If you get stuck, feel free to contact us for guidance! If your app is built with React, Angular or VUE JS framework, check out how to publish your app on Netlifly the easiest way.  

	b.	Register an ID on Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/), create a new app for your website (App New Site > Import an existing project), link the app to your GitHub repo, then choose a free hostname of your choice.
 
	c.	Enter the chosen hostname (where your website is accessed) in the first line of the README file of the repo. In the second line, enter your ID and in the third line, your name.
